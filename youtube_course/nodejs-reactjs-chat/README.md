Welcome to a simple real-time Chat project I-don't-know-how-to-name-it-yet!

This is a base for a small part of one of my school's projects

How to run:

- Backend:
    - cd backend
    - npm start

- Open another terminal
- Frontend:
    - cd frontend
    - npm run dev

-> It should work after

Technoligies used in this project :
    - NodeJs
    - axios
    - cors
    - chat engine (free version, 1000 messages limited, 10 users max)
    - ReactJs

What I should have done differently?
    - Maybe start with rocket chat from the beginning. It has a free version with unlimited messages. (Okay they said $0/user/month... What does that even mean)
